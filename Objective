In this project we aim to create a diffusion model to create segmentation mask for brain tumors from MRI data
Use pretrained diffusion model (MedSegDiff) to take in preprocessed data from Brats toolkit and create segmentation mask with uncertainty. 
We then train MedSegDiff, testing different normalization functions and error functions to maximize accuracy.
